The submitted SQL code was written in PostgreSQL.
The code should be opened in PostgreSQL if possible.
Ideally, you should open the DDL, DML, and SQL files in order (creating 3 separate tabs of code) and run each accordingly.

The DDL file constructs the framework of the data management system for all data that will be input later.
The DML file will contain all the individual data to be inserted into the framework that was constructed after running the DDL file.
Lastly, the SQL file will demonstrate a few queries of manipulating the data.

Feel free to reach out should you have any issues or have any questions.
